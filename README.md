# af-ng-virtual-keyboard
Open Source project

As currently there isn't any good virtual-keyboard for Angular, I decided to make my own one.
Most(or all) available virtual-keyboard libraries are based on inserting values into inputs.
I have idea to make virtual-keyboard which will be emitting imitations of real keyboard events.

## current version 0.0.0 (init)
