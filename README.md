# af-ng-virtual-keyboard
Open Source project

###### current version v0.0.2 (added styling and all keys)
###### doesn't work until v0.1.0 !

As currently there isn't any good virtual-keyboard for Angular, I decided to make my own one.
Most(or all) available virtual-keyboard libraries are based on inserting values into inputs.
I have idea to make virtual-keyboard which will be emitting imitations of real keyboard events.
